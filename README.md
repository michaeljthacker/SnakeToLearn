## Original README Content

A game of snake I made from scratch in learning JavaScript.

No promises here.

I am not an engineer of any variety, but I like to learn different languages in my freetime, and at one point, I decided to try to learn the basics of the web including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and even NodeJS. This is one of the early projects I took on personally just as a way to test my knowledge.

Status: As of March 2020, I had written enough of this to make it seem functional, but it absolutely has some major issues. Nonetheless, it did what I wanted.
